Yelp Dataset has 6 datasets:
- reviews
- user
- business
- checkin
- tips
- photos

For this project, we will be using only 3 datasets - reviews, user and business.

The main dataset of reviews (7 million rows) is split into several chunks of sizes:
- 1000 documents
- 10,000 documents
- 100,000 documents
- 1,000,000 documents ~ 1 million
- 5,000,000 documents ~ 5 million.

Other datasets of user and business are split on the basis of this.
