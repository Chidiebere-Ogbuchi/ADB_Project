The document database is category of the NoSQL database. It is a non-relational
database that stores and queries data from a JSON like format. In this study, we
explain the foundations of the document stores technology implemented over the
Arango and Marklogic database engines. The underlying concept was illustrated
using the Yelp dataset to explore and assess the performance of the databases used
over document stores. Furthermore for the study benchmarks, two db-engines are
selected in relation to the database requirements of the application. In general, the
benchmarks model was very essential aspect in comparing the Arango and Marklogic
as well as gain insight on the performance of both engines in order to identify suitable
application.
